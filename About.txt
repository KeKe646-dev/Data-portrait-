Durring the time period of when I began to create this project I caught a nasty cold. I belived that I could record the meals and beverageas that I consumed over the course of a couple days to see which foods and drinks I consumed repeatedly. As a result, Soup and water was my most repeated meal over the span of the week. I display this by making noodles out of multiple circles and then I created water dropletes on top of the noodels to represent the water I drank. 
All objects are centerned and spread out through the canvas so the veiwer has no specific focal point. 
After creataing the project I learned that my appitate changes drastically when I feel sick. Normally I would consume lots of solid foods and thicker bevarages; However when I am sisck I only stick to soft solids or liquids.
Through the data visualization, What was gained is the acknowlagement that the project is based on some type of physical object. What may have been lost is that the veiwer may not know this is about food based on the simplicity of the objects.
